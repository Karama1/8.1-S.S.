Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial. Their software requirements was to review and update their web-based software. They wanted us to address the security concernes for everything that could be wrong with their current web-based software.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did quite well when it turns to finding out the client's software vulnerability. I was able to find all the different issues and was able to fix them after a bit of work. It's important to code securely as messed up code that is not correctly checked can end up as a virus or something similar rather than a program that's helpful to people. Software security is what makes a companies wellbeing. The reasoning is that if all of their software is working perfectly, it's saving money and working as they wanted to. Issues in this lead to issues across the entire company rather than the issue of, maybe, a worker.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The  vilnerability assessment was easy once I found out what was wrong with my devices. For some reason my computer, being windows 10 home, doesn't want to work correctly when it comes to some of the vulnerability checks I need to do. This became a problem and I ended up borrowing my brother's computer and using his equipment in order to get the report I needed.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

When increasing layers of security, the more the bit the better. The encryption is based on how much bit there is, which is why 256-bit (most popular type currently) encryption is used over lower bit versions. In the future, I would use the a reduction mitigation technique. The less damage there is as a result of vulnerability, the better.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Wasn't able to figure this out on my computer

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

My brother's windows 10/11 computer would be helpful when using future assignments due to some weird restrictions given on my computer.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would be able to show that I know how to find vulnerabilities and impliment new ways of securing software.
